Description: The perturbR() function incrementally perturbs network edges (using the   rewireR function)and compares the resulting community detection solutions 
    from the rewired networks with the solution found for the original network. 
    These comparisons aid in understanding the stability of the 
    original solution. The package requires symmetric, weighted (specifically, count) matrices/networks.
